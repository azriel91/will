*Will* is a prototype 2.5D action adventure game, designed to be modded and extended by players.

As a game, it mimics 90's classics such as *Double Dragon* and *Streets of Rage*, where multiple players fight their way through a stage to show their prowess.

As a modding platform, players are encouraged to develop and share content through one or more of the following areas:

* **Spriting:** Drawing character, object, or stage art to add to the game
* **Scripting:** Defining behaviour for characters, objects, and stages
* **AI:** Defining how a character is automatically controlled by the computer

> üëÅÔ∏è Eyes on me. Let's go.

This update contains many improvements to game play and configuration.

{{< youtube JOZ9RiCFzdA >}}

What's new:

* Camera moves to track players, whilst staying within map bounds.
* Play sounds from object configuration.
* Spawn any kind of object, on any sequence.
* Transfer momentum when hit.

Configuration has the following changes:

* Markup language has switched from TOML to YAML.
* Acceleration for objects can be specified.
* Arbitrary sequence names can be used.
* Spawn position and velocity configuration use named axes.

The new version can be downloaded on [itch.io](https://azriel91.itch.io/will).

## Play

### Camera Tracking On Wide Maps

{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/camera_face_left.png" caption="Camera shifted towards left." >}}
{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/camera_middle.png" caption="Camera centered between tracked players." >}}
{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/camera_face_right.png" caption="Camera shifted towards right." >}}

On maps with a play area larger than the window, the game camera will follow the players. It will also be weighted towards the direction that players are facing.

### Hit Momentum

{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/momentum_weak.png" caption="Weak shot does not transfer much momentum." >}}
{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/momentum_mid.png" caption="Medium shot transfers more momentum." >}}

When hit, acceleration will be applied to objects -- weak attacks will only move objects a little; strong attacks will knock them further.

## Create

### Configuration

#### Markup Language

The markup language has been switched from TOML to YAML. This reduces repetition of key names for hierarchical data.

* TOML:

    {{< highlight toml "linenos=table" >}}
[sequences.stand]
  next = "repeat"

  [sequences.stand.transitions.press_attack]
    next = "stand_attack_weak"

  [[sequences.stand.transitions.release_attack]]
    next = "stand_attack_strong"
    requirements = [{ charge = 40 }]

  [[sequences.stand.transitions.release_attack]]
    next = "stand_attack_mid"
    requirements = [{ charge = 13 }]

  [[sequences.stand.frames]]
    wait = 8
    sprite = { sheet = 0, index = 0 }
    body = [{ box = { x = 16, y = 10, w = 28, h = 53 } }]
    {{< /highlight >}}

* YAML:

    {{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
sequences:
  stand:
    next: "repeat"
    transitions:
      press_attack: { next: "stand_attack_weak" }
      release_attack:
        - next: "stand_attack_strong"
          requirements: [{ charge: 40 }]
        - next: "stand_attack_mid"
          requirements: [{ charge: 13 }]

    frames:
      - wait: 8
        sprite: { sheet: 0, index: 0 }
        body: [{ box: { x: 16, y: 10, w: 28, h: 53 } }]
    {{< /highlight >}}

#### Additions

* Sound can be specified per frame:

    {{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
sequences:
  run:
    # ..
    frames:
      - wait: 2
        sound: "default/object/character/rox/rox_run.wav"
        # ..
    {{< /highlight >}}

* Any kind of object can be spawned, on specified sequence:

    {{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
# rox/object.yaml
spawns:
  - object: "default/rox"      # Spawns a Rox character.
    position: { x: -20, y: 0 } # Position of the spawned object relative to this object.
    velocity: { z: -20 }       # Velocity of the spawned object relative to this object.
    sequence: "run_clone"      # Spawned character begins on the "run_clone" sequence.
    {{< /highlight >}}

* Object acceleration to the object:

    {{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
sequences:
  run:
    next: "repeat"

    # Sequence level acceleration -- applied to all frames.
    acceleration:
      # Apply the acceleration continuously in the frame.
      kind: "continuous"
      x: { multiplier: "x_axis", value: 6.0 } # Multiply the value with X axis input.
      z: { multiplier: "z_axis", value: 1.5 } # Multiply the value with Z axis input.

    frames:
      - wait: 2
        # Override the sequence level acceleration for this frame.
        acceleration:
          kind: "once" # Apply the acceleration at the beginning of the frame.
          x: 8.0       # Use the acceleration value as is.
        # ..
    {{< /highlight >}}

* Hit interactions inflict acceleration:

    {{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
interactions:
  # Hit object velocity increases by 10 units to the right, and 5 units upwards.
  - hit: { acceleration: { x: 10, y: 5 }, .. }
    {{< /highlight >}}

### Spriting

<div>
<span style="display: inline-block;">{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/rox_walk.gif" caption="Walk" >}}</span>
<span style="display: inline-block;">{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/rox_run.gif" caption="Run" >}}</span>
<span style="display: inline-block;">{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/rox_jump.gif" caption="Jump" >}}</span>
</div>

This time sprites added to Rox to test the new features -- though not strictly necessary, it's useful to see sprites that represent actions that a feature is built for. The above sprites are made using [aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

### Sound Effects

{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/buster_shot_weak_wav.png" caption="Buster Shot Weak sound wave" >}}

The sound effects for Rox's run, and buster shots -- all 3 charge levels -- are voice recordings, and edited using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). Yeap, I was making *"pew!"* and *"wsshhhh"* sounds in my room.

### New Moves

{{< figure src="/media/2019-09-27_focus/rox_clone_attack.png" caption="Rox clone attack" >}}

With arbitrary sequence IDs added, new behaviours can easily be added to objects. The above move is defined with the following (trimmed) configuration:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
sequences:
  run_attack_clone:
    # ..

    frames:
      - # ..
        spawns:
          - { object: "default/rox", position: { x: -20 }, velocity: { z: -20 }, sequence: "run_clone" }
          - { object: "default/rox", position: { x: -10 }, velocity: { z: -10 }, sequence: "run_clone" }
          - { object: "default/rox", position: { x: -10 }, velocity: { z: 10 }, sequence: "run_clone" }
          - { object: "default/rox", position: { x: -20 }, velocity: { z: 20 }, sequence: "run_clone" }

  run_clone:
    next: "delete"
    acceleration:
      kind: "continuous"
      x: 8.0

    frames:
      - wait: 20
        sprite: { sheet: 0, index: 13 }
      - wait: 10
        sprite: { sheet: 0, index: 13 }
        spawns:
          - object: "default/buster_shot_weak"
            position: { x: 22, y: 33 }
            velocity: { x: 10, y: 0 }
{{< /highlight >}}

## What's Next

Yay, both the arbitrary sequence IDs and kinematics in configuration items have been implemented, and a lot more than that. The next period will focus on:

* Better menus / user interfaces.
* Better code maintenance.

*Just those two?*

Yeap. It takes a lot of effort to make a good *menu*; code maintenance needs substantial work -- this last development cycle traded maintainability for functionality. Until then.

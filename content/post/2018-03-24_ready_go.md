Hiya, it's Azriel.

I enjoy creating things, whether it's writing programs or making cards. I have always wanted to make a game, especially since I discovered and learnt how to modify [Little Fighter 2][lf2]. This was one of my favourite high school pastimes. In February 2018, I began to work on this full time.

The working title of the game is *Will* &mdash; as in willpower. It is intended to be a moddable action adventure 2.5D side-scroller. The rest of this post shows you what it will look like.

## Participation

There are 3 ways players will be able to participate:

* **Play:** Play the game.
* **Create:** Create your own character, weapon, or stage.
* **Socialize:** Link with other players, share your creations, post replays, and join events.

### Play

The following shows what the gameplay will be like:

{{< /gallery >}}

Multiple characters can be present on the same map, which focuses on the players' character area. The characters are able to move along the X and Y axes, and also up/down the Z axis..

Players control characters in real-time, instead of turn-based combat.

A story mode lets players learn the different personalities of each character, and how they came to be.

### Create

In addition to playing the game, players will be able to add their own creations to the game. The possibilities include spriting, scripting, and (static) AI scripting:

### Socialize

* **Link with other players**

    <i>Will</i> is intended to be a multiplayer game, both on the same computer, as well as over a local network or the internet.

* **Share your creations**

    {{< figure src="/img/2018-03-24_ready_go/08_share_creations.png" >}}

    Players will be able to share the characters, weapons, and stages they have created.

* **Post replays**

    {{< figure src="/img/2018-03-24_ready_go/09_replay.png" >}}

    Games will be recorded and replays will be able to be shared and watched.

* **Join events**

    {{< figure src="/img/2018-03-24_ready_go/10_events.png" >}}

    The following event types are planned to encourage interaction between players:

    - VS mode tournaments
    - Spriting competitions
    - AI vs AI tournaments
